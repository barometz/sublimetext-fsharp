F# syntax highlighting for Sublime Text, Linux-flavoured edition with sprinkles.

Based on [TextMate FSharp bundle][1] version 0.5. Changes/Fixes are more then
welcome!

Including a sublime-build for the [F# Open Source Edition][2] that can easily be 
adjusted for use on Windows by changing the name of the executable.
